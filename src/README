==Configuration==
The web UI can be accessed with your web browser at the port specified in
$HOME/.kde/share/apps/amarok/scripts/amarok-webui/conf.js (default is 8080).
Per default you need to authentiate for accessing the UI; the credentials 
can be set in conf.js as well (only basic HTTP auth, which is _not_ secure
on untrusted connections). The default ist 
	login=foo 
	passwd=bar67#
